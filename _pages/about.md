I am an AI researcher specializing in computational materials science and AI, currently working at Shell in Houston, Texas. In my current role, I utilize generative methods to discover new molecules for catalyst formulations. My research interests center around applying AI techniques to solve problems in chemistry and chemical engineering. Recently, I have been particularly excited about materials and molecular property prediction, graph neural networks, and uncertainty quantification.

I earned my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech in 2020 under of A.J. Medford, with my thesis focusing on the photocatalytic generation of ammonia for green fertilizers. Following my Ph.D., I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the SUNCAT Center at Stanford University, where I worked on electronic structure descriptors for predicting adsorption energies on oxide materials.

In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, hiking, and playing video games.
